# Algorithm Visualizer

## Build

### Visual Studio

Start screen → Open a local folder

**or**

File → Open → Folder

I don't recommend generating the project files with the `cmake` command since I cannot guarantee that it will work. Opening the folder as a CMake project is much better (in my opinion)

### Others

Run the `cmake` command to generate your project files.

This currently does not support G++. I've tested this on MSVC and Clang and they both seem to work. 

If you encounter any issues, open an issue to let me know.
