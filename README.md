# Algorithm Visualizer

## Build
### Visual Studio
Start screen → Open a local folder

**or**

File → Open → Folder

I don't recommend generating the project files with the `cmake` command since I cannot guarantee that it will work. Opening the folder as a CMake project is much better (in my opinion)

### Others
Run the `cmake` command to generate your project files.
