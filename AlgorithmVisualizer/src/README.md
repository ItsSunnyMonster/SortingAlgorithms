# SortingAlgorithms
A sorting algorithms visualizer I made in C++

## Build
At its current stage, it is only working on Windows (because I don't know how to link OpenGL on other platforms). You might be able to change the premake file to make it work for other platforms, but I am not bothered. 

To build the project for Visual Studio 2022 just run the `genbuild.bat` file. 
Otherwise run `.\deps\build\premake5.exe xxxx` on Windows or `./deps/build/premake5.exe xxxx` on \*nix.
